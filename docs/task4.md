!!! abstract "Info"
	Utilizing CAD (Call-Associated Data) variables passed from Webex Contact Center enables agents to streamline their workflows and operate more efficiently when addressing customer interactions and requests. These variables provide agents with critical information, such as customer details or interaction context, directly within their interface. By having instant access to this data, agents can reduce the need for manual lookups, save time, and deliver a more personalized and effective customer experience. This not only improves agent productivity but also enhances overall customer satisfaction.

!!! info "Task Objectives"
	- Configure Call Center in Salesforce for advanced screen pop functionality.
	- Customize and publish a Webex Contact Center flow with Salesforce integration.
	- Test the integration by triggering a Salesforce contact creation via a phone call.

- After logging in, navigate to the **'Flows'** menu on the left-hand side.

![Nav](./assets/t3s2p1.png){ width="200" }

- Search for the flow named **WX1_Salesforce_LabuserID** _(where **ID** is your selected pod number (01 through 30); i.e. WX1_Salesforce_Labuser02 if selected pod is 2)_ and open the flow by selecting **Go to Flow Designer** by clicking the icon on the right.

![Nav](./assets/t3s2p3.png){ width="800" }


- Click on an empty space in the flow, then on the right-hand side, scroll down to navigate to **'Custom Variables > Flow Variables'** section.
- Click on **sfurl** flow variable, select the **'Edit'** option (pencil icon), replace **NN** with the attendee number which is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) from your Salesforce lab (e.g., _wx1-lab01-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com_;) as the Default Value, and click **'Save'**.

!!! warning "Attention" 
	The FQDN used for the **sfurl** variable must end with **.lightning.force.com**. While logged into the Salesforce portal, you can find the name of the Salesforce organization in the browser's address field.
	Note that the Salesforce Setup page will have a different domain ending (it does not end with **.lightning.force.com**). To obtain the correct FQDN, you can either navigate to the Salesforce Sales app and copy the full FQDN from the browser's address field there, or copy the Salesforce organization name from the Salesforce Setup page from the browser's address field and append it with **.lightning.force.com**.

- Note down the **'Support Number'** associated with this channel - it will be needed later in this lab for testing.

## **Section 3 - Testing**

!!! warning "Attention"
	Please use the **Firefox** browser to access, configure, and test within the Salesforce portal.

- Make sure that the agent state is set to 'Available' and then call the channel number (noted from the steps above). In the IVR, choose **option 4**.
- Since Salesforce does not recognize your number, a new **Contact** create window will open with the phone number prefilled.
- Provide a name and save the contact in Salesforce.

![Nav](./assets/t3s3p1.png){ width="1000" }

- End the call.
- Wrapup the session, make sure that the agent state is set to 'Available' and make another call. In the IVR, choose **option 4** again.
- This time, the system will open the matching contact, as it was created in the previous step.
